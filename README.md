# Project title: Predicting airfares for 2025 based on location, past fares, and oil prices
# Motivation: Project came about in an effort to identify the best airports in the US to fly out of in terms of airfare, and how the populations of the areas those airports serve, along with the average price of a barrel of oil during the respective year. While knowing full well that one cannot predict the future, the data has merely been used as a way to create a prediction based on data from the past.
# Code: Initial plan was to incorporate use of APIs, but the goal proved too unweildy for a short project timeframe. However, webscraping has been utilized to pull data regarding the largest air traffic hubs in the United States. Code also utilizes machine learning to predict how the trajectory of prices might continue.
# Data: Pulled from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the Energy Information Administration, and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, as well as webscraping data from Wikipedia 
# Features: Data visualization via Tableau in order to more graphically depict conclusions drawn from data analysis.
